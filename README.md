### Im Ronit.

I was always a lover of words and stories. I studied literature in college, immersing myself in the beauty of language and the power of storytelling. But as I progressed in my studies, I found myself increasingly drawn to the world of technology.

It all started with a simple curiosity about how the apps and websites I used every day were built. I began to tinker with code, learning the basics of HTML and CSS. As I delved deeper, I discovered a whole new world of possibilities, and I knew that this was what I wanted to do.

Despite being a literature student, I decided to pursue a career in technology. I taught myself to code, studying React Native, Flutter, and Solidity, and honing my skills through endless nights of coding and experimentation.
